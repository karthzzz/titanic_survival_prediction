## Overview

This repository contains a Python project for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze various features and predict whether a passenger would survive or not.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Explore the Titanic dataset to understand the distribution of features and gain insights into the passenger demographics.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and prepare the data for training the machine learning model.

- **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers based on relevant features.

- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Requirements

- Python [version]
- [List any additional dependencies]
